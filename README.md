2048
====

My own attempt to recreate the game 2048 in the browser

##Setup

 Make sure node.js is installed and symlinked as node so that less can run.

 ``` sh
 sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy
 ```

##Installation

 Run the following command from the root directory:

 ``` sh
 make install
 ```
